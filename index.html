           <p class="vr">Virtual Reality has been a huge step in the gaming industry and technology, taking gamers in a 360 experience. VR sets are in continous development due to the high demand and the many upgrading posibilities. When we talk about gaming on PC’s, PlayStations or Xbox there is not much to add, not much expanding left with the platforms, only the game industries can try and develop better games. With the VR there is a completely different story because it hasn’t existed for long and industries are trying to create the best sets in order to enhance the experience. Virtual Reality is already great but they hope to achieve the greatest.

                Ambitious development of VR sets is the Oculus Quest. A lot of people still don’t know about VR so, for instance, whenever I have the chance, I let people use my Oculus Rift to experience the virtual reality. A lot of them enjoy it or love it and  consider buying one themselves. The price is affordable for such a technology and they seem surprised to discover that. However, as soon as I tell them about the need of a gaming PC which is more expensive they give up the idea. The truth is that nowadays only gamers love to have a big, performant PC for gaming. Normal people who don’t have a passion for games use portable devices such as laptops. So Oculus came with a solution: The Oculus Quest.
                The Oculus Quest is a standalone VR set which as performance and graphics quality is better than the Oculus Go but lower than Oculus Rift. The Quest is exactly what people mentioned above need, a VR set that doesn’t need anything else but itself. You don’t need any PC or platform, which makes it really convenient, especially knowing that its price is no different than Oculus Rift so it is still affordable. As for the realease date, they hope to realese it in spring 2019 at the same price of Oculus Rift.

           <p>Earlier this month, The Washington Post broke the news that NASA would conduct reviews of workplace culture in both SpaceX and Boeing following Musk’s behavior on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. While the national space agency refused to provide a specific reason for the audit, it hinted that it wanted to check if the employees at these companies were sober at work:

                [The agency] will be conducting a cultural assessment study in coordination with our commercial partners to ensure the companies are meeting NASA’s requirements for workplace safety, including the adherence to a drug-free environment.
                
                Bridenstine told The Atlantic that the audits were done to avoid tragedies similar to those in NASA’s history. That includes the Apollo 1 fire in 1967 that killed three astronauts, and the Challenger (1986) and Columbia (2003) Space Shuttle disasters which together killed 14 people.
                
                He said that while technological mishaps were big contributors to these accidents, the workplace culture of the contractors could not be ruled out as a possible reason.
                
                Bridenstine added that he wanted to review the workplace culture in SpaceX and Boeing even before Musk smoked weed publicly.
                
                NASA’s contracts with SpaceX and Boeing, both issued in 2013, require the contractors to “maintain a program for achieving a drug-and alcohol-free workforce.” They also require the companies to conduct “preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, post-accident, and periodic recurring testing of contractor employees in sensitive positions for use, in violation of applicable law or federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance.”
                
                In this light, it is understandable why the NASA admin would condemn Musk’s behavior on the podcast.
                
                Even if smoking weed was legal in California, where the Joe Rogan podcast was made, Musk’s act may be seen as the CEO of SpaceX promoting a brand of workplace culture that’s not in line with what’s expected of his company as an aerospace technology business. While it is debatable if that would have any effect on SpaceX employees, NASA’s intention to err on the side of caution is also valid, as the agency has the lives of its own astronauts to worry about.</p>
