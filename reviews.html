                <h2>Flexbox Froggy</h2>
                <p>If you are a beginner in web development and you want to learn more about CSS layout then Flexbox Froggy is one of the easiest ways to do it. Flexbox Froggy is a game that teaches you the flexbox proprieties. You will get on it fast because of its simple explanations and exemplifications and who doesn’t like games? Due to the visual responsive representation of the flexbox proprieties using the frogs and nenuphars, the proprieties are easy to learn and differentiate.</p>

                <p>At the end of the game you will be able to recognize flexbox proprieties and in case you forget them you can always come back to it because the answers remain saved and you won’t have to go again through the game. 
                    The only unpleasant thing I realised is that you learn the proprieties but it lacks context, you may find yourself not knowing how to apply the proprieties you know or on what to apply them, so that is the only reason Flexbox Froggy gets 4 out of 5 stars.

                    <h2>Codeacademy</h2>
                    <p>Codeacademy is popular among beginners in web development, being one of the best platforms for learning programming and seeing the progress. Codeacademy has a self-learning environment that lets you choose between a variety of courses such as HTML, CSS, Python and so many more. It is the perfect tool for a beginner to shape their way to becoming a Full-stack developer.</p>
                    
            <p>When you choose a course such as a programming language, you can get the basics for free. If you want to learn everything there is about that course you can pay for it and ditch university. The interface is user-friendly, and you get instant feedback after every step. You can start a course now and resume it after 3 months and you will be in the same place you left. At first sight the platform seems to be perfect but once you start using other resources and learn more you can see that in the free basic learning there are a few basic things that are not mentioned at all. Nobody is perfect but Codeacademy is near with 4.5 out of 5 stars. </p>

                    <h2>Mozilla MDN</h2>
                        <p>Mozilla MDN has resources for any developers, no matter if they are a beginner or an expert. Mozilla MDN is an evolving learning platform for web technologies, having helpful information and tutorials for developers. It is made by developers for developers.

                <p>Any problem I had with web development and any trick I wanted to learn, MDN always helped me. It is not as supporting as Codeacademy when it comes to feedback, it is not as colourful and easy to get as Flexbox Froggy, but it is the best platform for resources. Think of it as a dictionary, every term being explained and exemplified. Not only you will find languages and proprieties but also tutorials, developer tools and much more. The Mozilla MDN might be the only one that gets a 5 out of 5 stars from me.</p>
